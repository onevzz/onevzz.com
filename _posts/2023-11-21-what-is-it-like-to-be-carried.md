---

Ever since I got into university, things never cease to amaze me.
Whether that be the people here or the time and place that I have to adjust to.
But one thing is clear here, people around me are fucking wild.
I have seen someone working a **full-time job** as a software developer
alongside with being an undergraduate student in computer science.
I have seen people who participated in multiple "Hackathons" while studying.
And I have seen people who are just great at what they do.
Some could even assist a professor in teaching programming in Python,
and by "assisting" I meant that they could teach throughout the entire session.
How do I know it, you may ask. Because I have seen one that did exactly that.
We are still in our **freshmen** year, mind you.
I felt like I just couldn't keep up with the people around me.
Knowing how to code up a web application with a database seems to be the minimum here.
Maybe I'm exaggerating, but those are my feelings on it.
Now that I prefaced this, let's get to the gist of this article.

## What makes a carry?

The meaning of the word "carry" can mean a lot of things.
But to me and many people, it'll remind us of the people who **carried us** throughout a period of time,
Whether that be in group projects, exotic missions or life in general.
For example, the "carry" of any particular group project is somebody who does a majority of the work.
And now that we have established the term, let's move on to meeting our highlight of this article.

## Meet Ton Kla!

_Look at them go!_

**The MIGHTINESS that Ton Kla has cannot be explained by words.**
Even ones like **superb** and **sublime** just couldn't cut it.
He is simply **legendary**. It seems like this dude could do anything to the exponent of mine.
He knows everything and can do anything, and so is his glorious white owl sitting on his head.
All of these aside, he is one great person. He carried me throughout the whole thing!
Wait, you got no context? Well, how about me showing you what that "thing" is.

## CU CALENDAR

_The Generate Timetables Feature of the App_

**CU CALENDAR** is a calendar web application that is intended to be used by the students at our university.
Anything a standard calendar app could do, this app could do too, plus many more handy features for students,
like automatically pulling your schedule based on your course list from the university's official site.
But one killer feature of it is the ability to generate all possible timetables of any given course list.
This saves the student from having to deal with headaches rising from having to design their own schedule manually.

I knew nothing going in to this, and he knew everything!
Sure, I did some continuous integration with docker and made some desperate attempt to contribute,
but they're nothing compared to what he did. He structured the entire project and did most of the features,
while also keeping up with the grinding subjects of our freshmen year, absolute chad.
I'm forever grateful for what he did, and hope that he gets to live the happiest meaningful life ever.

## So how is university?

Having to study for exams with projects on the fly is a lot harder than what I initially thought.
While it may not be as hard as it should be for me, because hehe **withdrawal!**,
but I reckon that it's hard nonetheless. So, thumbs up to my friends who are still doing fine.
Because university is one hell of a beach, and that I should go to sleep now. Goodnight! Stay cool!
