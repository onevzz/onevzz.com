Technological advances are supposed to make our lives easier, healthier and overall more fullfilling.
I started out as an enthusiast in technology, always keeping up with the latest tech trend.
But as of now, most of my perspective has changed. So in this article,
I'll share my perspective on why I ended up with a dumbphone and the caveman attitude I have towards technology,
despite my interest in computer science.

# Making sure we're on the same page

I'm not trying to convince anyone to adapt to a specific lifestyle or present a certain manifesto that revolves
around being anti-technology. It's about sharing my thoughts and experiences to help you decide on living your
best life, whatever it may be. Also, this article is one of my highly opinionated one, so please keep that in mind.

# Starting as a child

Like many others, I was introduced to technology at a very young age.
Although that did influenced me in a lot of positive ways, like getting me to learn about computers and technology,
It also came with tons of negative effects and missed opportunities,
especially with the widespread use of internet and social media.

# Certain technologies are addictive

Especially with social media, it is designed to grab as much time
and attention from you as possible. So using them responsibly can be very challenging, at least from my point of view.
If you're currently in disbelief, I'd advise you to check your smartphone screen time, assuming that you had one.
Most people I know of are not necessary pleased with the results, including me.
And if you found yourself relating to any of these statements, maybe it is time for a change,
whether it's through establishing a good boundary between you and your technologies, or stepping away completely.
But my point is that if you continue on not doing anything about it,
chances are that screen time will be a thing for the rest of your life, and I'm here to warn you before it's too late.

# Smart devices are prone to failures

I've never seen a good ol' notepad crashes before, nor running out of battery.
Implementing devices that are prone to failures into important aspects of your life can be very frustating,
if taken without any backup plan. It may not appear to be a problem given that the applications are minimal,
but on larger scales where everything is connected with a dependency on one another, it's a whole another story.

Some companies are even incorporating redundancy into their smart devices to maximise profits,
notably the smartphone companies. Common strategy in play involves deliberately slowing down older phones.
Which ensures that smartphones will fail before their realistic lifespan, to which I personally despise.

# Technology is exceeding human capabilities

It seems like all of these are coming down to the fact that the world is trying to move forward in a much faster fashion,
to the point where it had exceeded human capabilities in an unhealthy way. A prime example is through communications,
I think being connected together in a twenty-four seven timeframe can be very tiring for us, as it was for me.
Gratification is another thing that I wanted to talk about. With internet being the main source of entertainment nowadays,
a lot of people have completely forgotten about simpler things like reading books and going outside for a walk.
Constant heavy load of instant gratification from technology can indeed be harmful to us.

# Wrapping up this article

Technology can be very empowering when used in a responsible manner. But for me personally, I've had enough of it
draining away my time and energy that I'd rather spend it elsewhere, on the things that actually matter to me.
I understand that not all people are like me, so that's why I encourage you to take a trip down the memory lane just
to see whether your relationship with technology is toxic and requires attention or not.
This also applies to other domains in your life as well, as it doesn't hurt to re-evaluate your life every now and then.
As always, stay cool.
